Task One (Python):
1. Read the pupae data
2. Convert ’CO2_treatment’ to a factor/categorical discrete variable. Inspect the levels of this
factor variable.
3. Make a scatter plot of Frass vs. PupalWeight, with blue solid circles for a CO2 concentration of
280ppm and red for 400ppm. Also add a legend.
4. The problem with the above figure is that data for both temperature treatments is combined.
Make two plots (either in a PDF, or two plots side by side), one with the ’ambient’ temperature
treatment, one with ’elevated’.
5. In the above plot, make sure that the X and Y axis ranges are the same for both plots.
6. Instead of making two separate plots, make one plot that uses different colors for the CO(2)
treatments and different symbols for the ’ambient’ and ’elevated’ temperature treatments.
Choose some nice symbols from the help page of the points function.
7. Add two legends to the above plot, one for the temperature treatment (showing different
plotting symbols), and one for the CO2 treatments (showing different colours).
8. Generate the same plot as above but this time add a single legend that contains symbols and
colours for each treatment combination (CO2 : T).
